Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the major public health diseases in the world which is 
progressively increasing day by day and already had its effect on many countries. Early 
and accurate diagnosis of PD is crucial for the management of the disease and to improve 
the quality of life of patients. In this project, the SVM algorithm was used for the 
classification of PD. Initially, the whole baseline features were used in the SVM
algorithm and the model is trained using various dataset then input is given by the user 
then model predict the result. The performance of these model is evaluated using various 
metrics such as accuracy and high sensitivity. The model is trained and tested on the data 
set and the model is able to accurately predict Parkinson’s disease with a high accuracy 
rate. The result of this project is to demonstrate the potential of using machine learning 
as a tool for early detection of Parkinson's disease, which can aid in timely intervention 
and management of the condition
