Data Collection & Analysis

# printing the first 5 rows of the dataframe
parkinsons_data.head()

# number of rows and columns in the dataframe
parkinsons_data.shape

# getting more information about the dataset
parkinsons_data.info()

# checking for missing values in each column
parkinsons_data.isnull().sum()

# getting some statistical measures about the data
parkinsons_data.describe()

# distribution of target Variable
parkinsons_data['status'].value_counts()

# grouping the data bas3ed on the target variable
parkinsons_data.groupby('status').mean()

Splitting the data to training data & Test data

Support Vector Machine Model

Accuracy Score

# accuracy score on training data
